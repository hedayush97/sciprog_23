In this practical, we will create a program that displays the Fibonacci series upto n and the hyperbolic arc tangent which can be expressed as a Maclaurin series.
To compile the codes, run the following commands -
gcc -o scanf scanf.c -Wall
./scanf

gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c -Wall
./fibonacci

gcc -o arct arct.c -lm -Wall
./arct
