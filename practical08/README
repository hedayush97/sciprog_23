In this practical, we will workk on recursive functions.

We will do the following things - 
1. Use the pseudo code to construct an iterative function.
2. Construct a recursive function to do the same, using the formula below the pseudo code.

To compile the code, run the following command:
gcc -o out gcd.c -Wall
./out
